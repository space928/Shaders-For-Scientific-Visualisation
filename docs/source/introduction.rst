*pySSV* makes it easy to use shaders in Jupyter notebooks.

To get started, create a suitable python environment (optional if you already have a python environment with
jupyterlab setup), and install the package using ``pip``::

    conda create -n pySSV -c conda-forge python jupyterlab
    conda activate pySSV

    pip install pySSV

Download the example notebook from github :download:`introduction.ipynb <../../examples/introduction.ipynb>`

The example notebook can also be viewed here (:doc:`/examples/introduction`).

Start JupyterLab and play around with the notebook::

    jupyter lab .\introduction.ipynb
